# Arctic Engine

This is an alpha version of a game engine built using the pygame framework in Python.

This code is NOT COMPLETE. This is a rebuild of a first attempt I made at creating the arctic engine, [see here](https://github.com/karkin2002/Project-Arctic). The new engine should be better performing, cleaner, easier to use, and friendlier with different window dimensions and scalings. Although the last version of the engine ran on Linux based systems, I am partially developing this engine on a Linux machine and will ensure continued compatibility.

## Things I want to add

- Trigger Component
- Collision Component
- Particles 
- Image Rotation
- Persistent Config Info 

## Making Use of this code

Source my name & GitHub Repo address when using this code.
